Contains lecture code-alongs of the Neural Networks from scratch playlist.

Contains an independent attempt to code back-propagation, inspired from the above playlist and a Neural Networks series by 3 Blue 1 Brown. This has not yet been tested, or verified by someone else.
Have to rewrite that, making the code more clean, once I learn NumPy better.
