# Seasons of Code 2024

## Graph Neural Network Models for Network Analysis and Generation

### Overview

This repository contains my work and learning journey during the Seasons of Code 2024. The resources and code include lecture code-alongs from the Sentdex playlist and assignments from Andrew NG's Deep Learning Specialization. It was pretty fun trying to write backpropagation on code on my own, and I don't think I did a really bad job, all thanks to the intuition given by [3-Blue 1-Brown](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLZHQObOWTQDNU6R1_67000Dx_ZCJB-3pi).
